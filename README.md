About
=================
These are support plugins for [FMoviesPlus.bundle](https://github.com/coder-alpha/FMoviesPlus.bundle) (aka FMP - a Plex plugin). These support plugins add additional functionality to FMP. Some of these types of plugins are already bundled with FMP. These additional ones that I believe will have lesser widespread usage will be made available in this repository.

There are 3 types of support plugins.
- Provider
- Resolver
- Proxy

How to Install ?
=================
To Install a plugin, simply download and copy the file into your FMP installation under its matching directory located under ..\FMoviesPlus.bundle\Contents\Libraries\Shared\resources\lib\ and restart PMS for the plugin to get loaded. The new support plugin should then be visible via the FMP menu > Options > Interface Options >
